# If the AMETHST repo was cloned into your home, you can run the test analysis as follows
# First, make sure AMETHST is in your path ( export PATH=$PATH:~/AMETHST/ ), then 
# can run AMETHST in one of two ways
# to run with perl code locally:
>cd ~/AMETHST/test_analysis

>AMETHST.pl -f test_commands

# to run with the AMETHST KBase serive

>mg-amethst --commands test_commands --token shock_token

# that's it
